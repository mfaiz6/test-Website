 <!--We can also use the <i></i> tag which means to just italise text. It does italise the text but if we use <em></em> which means emaphasis; it is actually used to tell the browser to give more importance to the content inside it. This is the measure difference between <i> and <em>. it is recomender to use em-->
        <!--Similarly, there is another pair of tags <b></b> meaning bold and <strong></strong> which also makes the text bold but is actually used to tell the browser that the content inside it has more importance, so it is better to use strong tag.
        Note: While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), <strong> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both <strong> and <em> can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.-->
